This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.

The issue occurs when passing absolute URLs rather than protocol-relative URLs to axios. Even if ?baseURL is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios. This issue is fixed in 1.8.2.\n\n\n### 🔗 References\n- [Data Source](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6)\n- [View finding in Wiz](https://app.wiz.io/findings/vulnerability-findings#~(entity~(~%27d92f1d59-9c93-5ed7-89d2-fb75e1f26761*2cSECURITY_TOOL_FINDING)))\n- [View vulnerability in catalog](https://app.wiz.io/policies/vulnerability-catalog#~(filters~(search~(contains~%27CVE-2025-27152))~cve~%27CVE-2025-27152))\n"

This issue was patched in versions 15.1.6 and 14.2.24 by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from incoming requests. Applications hosted on Vercel's platform are not affected by this issue, as the platform does not cache responses based solely on `200 OK` status without explicit `cache-control` headers. Those who self-host Next.js deployments and are unable to upgrade immediately can mitigate this vulnerability by stripping the `x-now-route-matches` header from all incoming requests at the content development network and setting `cache-control: no-store` for all responses under risk. The maintainers of Next.js strongly recommend only caching responses with explicit cache-control headers.\n\n\n### 🔗 References\n- [Data Source](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qpjv-v59x-3qc4)\n- [View finding in Wiz](https://app.wiz.io/findings/vulnerability-findings#~(entity~(~%27161c3141-564f-5036-bda2-ab491efc0f98*2cSECURITY_TOOL_FINDING)))\n- [View vulnerability in catalog](https://app.wiz.io/policies/vulnerability-catalog#~(filters~(search~(contains~%27CVE-2025-32421))~cve~%27CVE-2025-32421))\n"
